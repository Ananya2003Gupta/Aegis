## Aegis: Protecting Smart Contracts with AI

**Aegis** is a smart contract audit and analysis tool powered by artificial intelligence, dedicated to safeguarding your Solidity code from vulnerabilities. 

**Why Aegis?**

Traditional security approaches like manually defining patterns are time-consuming, require deep expertise, and struggle to keep up with ever-evolving threats. Aegis leverages the power of machine learning to offer a faster, more comprehensive solution:

* **AI-powered Analysis:** Our ResNet model, trained on a massive dataset of real-world smart contracts, can identify vulnerabilities with **65% accuracy**, highlighting potential risks before deployment.
* **Fast and Efficient:** Compared to symbolic execution tools, Aegis provides rapid analysis, saving you valuable development time.
* **No Expert Dependency:** Unlike rule-based methods reliant on predefined patterns, Aegis doesn't require expert knowledge to use, making it accessible to all developers.

**Key Features:**

* **Vulnerability Detection:** Identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, including reentrancy, integer overflow, and access control issues.
* **Solidity Support:** Analyze and scan your Solidity code for potential threats.
* **Clear Reporting:** Receive detailed reports highlighting vulnerabilities, their severity levels, and suggested fixes.
* **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrate Aegis into your development workflow with a user-friendly CLI interface.

**Technical Details:**

* **Model:** ResNet architecture trained on 80k records and validated against 11k records.
* **Accuracy:** 65% on the validation set.
* **CLI Options:** info, scan, compile, help

**Getting Started:**

1. **Installation:** Follow the installation instructions available on []
2. **Usage:** Use the intuitive CLI commands to scan your Solidity code for vulnerabilities.
3. **Review Results:** Analyze the generated report to understand potential risks and implement suggested fixes.

**Beyond the Basics:**

We believe transparency is key. Our open-source approach allows you to delve into the workings of Aegis and customize it to your specific needs. You can access the source code and contribute to its development on our GitHub repository.
